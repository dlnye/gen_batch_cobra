Script to generate batch file to feed multiple runs of the EPA 
CO-Benefits Risk Assessment Health Impacts Screening and Mapping Tool (COBRA)
with different county-level emissions data.

This makes it easier to estimate cumulative emissions reduction health impacts
for a series of years and/or different discount rates, for example.
For more information about COBRA's batch file capability see the user manual,

NOTE: This is could be refactored and made into a function but this was a one-off task so 
I did not do this.
